      "I already had a good idea of what I want in a college before I started it. I went to a small, private college and stayed away from bigger, massive universities. Most, if not all, of these colleges are very big. So I couldn't easily rank them by that (my college you could walk across campus in 10 minutes, slow walking!). That said, I tended to rank the best ones in cooler weather climates (I hate warm/hot weather). So you won't see anything in Florida on my list. I'm also very liberal, so I try to avoid conservative places (though I did rank some higher that are in conservative states due to their liberal town setting). I also went more for some of the colleges that are lesser known, but still really good (i.e.- Clark University). I would fit in better places like that. So that was my general strategy! Fun HIT!\n",

      "I went by the colleges i actually knew something about. i live in LA so i know tulane and LSU are good. i grew up in upstate NY so i know albany and binghamton are decent. and i put a few i had never heard of in the last category.\n",
      "I tried to focus on colleges near my area (Chicago) and more famous universities like Harvard. These are the institutions I know the most about.\n",
      "no\n",
      "I wanted to compare colleges that I thought were similar, and that have interactions with each other. I also wanted to make one of the sides clearly larger to not skew results. I wanted to really get a sense of the full spectrum. I felt in this way it would broaden the rankings for me.\n",

      "I put reputable colleges in my \"High\" ranking. Schools that were ranked the highest by the AP. They were schools I would like to go to, whether or not I would get in, but they were good schools with good academic backgrounds. For the Middle section, I put schools that I liked that I would consider going to. For the Low section, I put schools in regions of the country that are just too far away from friends and family. These are schools I wouldn't want to go to at all. I also put some low ranking schools there so the system would know I wanted to go to a higher ranked school. I was hoping the system would pick up on both the rankings and geographical locations of my rankings, but it seems like it did not.\n",

      "i just guess by the news ranking about the colleges, the news can't provide fake details so i can try this way.\n",
      "I wanted to rank public and large colleges vs smaller private colleges. I wanted large state schools and universities over private institutions.\n",
      "Just wanted to include all the colleges I looked at as a high school senior as well as premed and then as a grad school applicant. It has my alma maters and that's all that matters.i think they us world news report ranking was closer than the default ranking which was significantly different from my own ranking.(This interface is not easy to use or seemed to be helpful)\n",

      "I attempted to rank colleges by tuition cost, favoring lower cost colleges. However both times I applied my ranking method, the results were not as expected. The tuition ranking seemed random when I expected to see cost listed from lowest to highest. also, on the ranking page, it would not let me sort by rank.\n",
      "I looked at ones I was familiar with, plus some places I would like to live.  Then I looked at ranking plus tuition.\n"
