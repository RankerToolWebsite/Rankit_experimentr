Most, if not all, of these colleges are very big. So I couldn't easily rank them by that (my college you could walk across campus in 10 minutes, slow walking!). That said, I tended to rank the best ones in cooler weather climates (I hate warm/hot weather). So you won't see anything in Florida on my list. I'm also very liberal, so I try to avoid conservative places (though I did rank some higher that are in conservative states due to their liberal town setting). I also went more for some of the colleges that are lesser known, but still really good (i.e.- Clark University). I would fit in better places like that. So that was my general strategy! Fun HIT!"
