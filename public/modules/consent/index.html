    <h2 class="placeholder">Personalized College Ranker</h2><br/>

	  <p>College rankings are a valuable tool used by many students when they are considering whether 
	  to apply to a certain school. However, published rankings do not take into account the preferences 
	  of individual students.</p><br/> 
 
          <p><b>Task: </b></p>
	  <p>Your task is to create a personalized college ranking. On the following pages, you will be 
	    presented with a dataset of colleges, and asked to input your preferences about some of them. 
	    From this partial information that you provide, the system will learn a global ranking over all 
	    the items in the dataset. Then you will be asked to give feedback on your experience and 
	    understanding of the ranking process.</p><br/>
