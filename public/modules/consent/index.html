    <h2 class="placeholder">Personalized College Ranker</h2><br/>

	  <p>College rankings are a valuable tool used by many students when they are considering whether 
	  to apply to a certain school. However, published rankings do not take into account the preferences 
	  of individual students.</p><br/> 
 
     <p><b>Task: </b></p>
	  <p>Your task is to create a personalized college ranking. On the following pages, you will be 
	    presented with a dataset of colleges, and asked to input your preferences about some of them. 
	    From this partial information that you provide, the system will learn a global ranking over all 
	    the items in the dataset. Then you will be asked to give feedback on your experience and 
	    understanding of the ranking process.</p>

<h4>Informed Consent Agreement for Participation in a Research Study</h4> <br>    
    <p> <b>Investigators:</b> Paul-Henry Schoenhagen </p> <br> 
    <p><b>Contact Information:</b> Email at pmschoenhagen@wpi.edu</p> <br> 
<p><b>Title of Research Study:</b> RanKit: Designing Interactive Tools for Ranking Analysis</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> You are invited to participate in a research study to evaluate the usability and functionality of a ranking application. Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation.  This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation.</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>Purpose of the study:</b>  Many existing rankings target general audiences, yet cannot take into account individual preferences. We have developed a web application to help users customize and interpret rankings to meet their own end goals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability and functionality of our application and to get feedback for improvement.</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>Procedures to be followed:</b>  Your participation will consist of a single Mechanical Turk HIT where you will be asked to create a ranking using our ranking application. Afterwards, you will be asked to rate the overall quality of the interaction using our questionnaire. There are no right or wrong answers. The questionnaire should take approximately 5 - 10 minutes to complete.</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>Risks to study participants:</b>  This study involves the following risks: minimal fatigue and eyestrain from looking at a screen. There may be other risks that we cannot predict. In case of discomfort, you may choose to discontinue your participation at any time without penalty.</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>Benefits to research participants and others:</b> You will be paid for each HIT completed, but other than that: there are no direct benefits for you to participate in this study.</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>Record keeping and confidentiality:</b> Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study investigators, the sponsor or it’s designee and, under certain circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to your Amazon account information during data collection. This information will be stripped from the final dataset. Your individual answers will not be published; end results will be aggregated before publication. Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you.
        
    <p><b>Compensation or treatment in the event of injury:</b> No compensation will be made for injuries resulting from participation in this study. You do not give up any of your legal rights by signing this statement.</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>For more information about this research or about the rights of research participants, or in case of research-related injury, contact:</b> pmschoenhagen@wpi.edu or the Principal Investigator, Elke Rundensteiner, at rundenst@wpi.edu. In addition, you may also contact the chair of the WPI Institutional Review Board (Prof. Kent Rissmiller, Tel. 508-831-5019, Email: kjr@wpi.edu) or WPI’s Human Protection Administrator (Gabriel Johnson, Tel. 508-831-4989, Email: gjohnson@wpi.edu).</p> <br> 
 
    <p><b>Your participation in this research is voluntary.</b>  Your refusal to participate will result only in loss of payment from Mechanical Turk.  You may decide to stop participating in the research at any time.</p> <br>   
 
    <p><b>By clicking “I Agree”,</b> you acknowledge that you have been informed about and consent to be a participant in the study described above. You are entitled to retain a copy of this consent agreement.</p> <br>
